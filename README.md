An application that parses through a .csv listing Employee ID, Project ID, Start Date and End Date, and shows which pair of employees cooperated the longest on projects.

Backend is PHP, frontend is Vue.js

I've provided 2 frontend solutions to the Bonus Task, because I am not sure what is meant by DataGrid (generic table or specific solution).

I've included packages, as I'm unfamiliar how hard it is to get the same setup/compatability.

Example .csv is provided in /resources directory

Host PHP: php -S localhost:3333 -t backend

Host VITE: cd frontend; npm run dev

Access app: localhost:5173
